## Overview
As a user, I want to improve my perspective of life situations by reading streams of advice

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Generate a new piece of advice by clicking the dice icon

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

My biggest learning was in JS. Specifically using the curly brackett [{] after ```(data => )```. My previous approach was to write ```(function(data){code})```. But I prefer  ```(data => {code})````

Also learnt more about position relative. Assumed it had to be used along with position absolute on the parent.
position relative can be set on any tag or element. This will make the tag's position relative to its original position in the html

### Continued development
I intend on learning more about the CSS position property. Commiting an hour to read MDN docs on position.


### Useful resources

- [Scrimba Lesson on API] - This is an amazing tutorial which helped me finally understand fetch API and its methos. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
